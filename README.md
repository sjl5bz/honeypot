# honeypot
Which Honeypot(s) you deployed: I deployed the dionaea honeypot    
Any issues you encountered: I had issues with making all the ports open. I am using AWS instead of Google's cloud service. When running the nmap command, only 1 port would show up. I had to go back and change the security rules for the ports.    
A summary of the data collected: There were 198 attacks done. pcap protocols and smdb protocols were used. Attacks are coming to all different ports. Countries weren't specified.
